	So a website seems to be a place I think is a great idea to write about stuff, then shortly after that I lose the will to do it, 3 years down the line I re-start the cycle
</p>
<p><strong>WELL NOT THIS TIME BUDDY</strong></p>

<p>
	This design is cruddy, its old, 3 years old to be precise. So im going to tszuj it up a bit. My role at escape has also changed, I'm now a HTML5 Game Developer at <a href="http://www.sideplay.com">Sideplay</a> and have been for the last 2 years or so.
</p>

<p>
	So with my now game development oriented role, I feel that the theme should be more gamey, something slightly interactive perhaps? We'll see how it pans out this cycle!
